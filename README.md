## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Milica, but you can call me Millie!

I'm a student at a 42 Network school, building a strong foundation in C and C++ through hands-on, project-based learning. My long-term goal is to become a penetration tester within the next five years, and Iâ€™m actively working towards it by deepening my knowledge in cybersecurity, network security, and ethical hacking.

Iâ€™m always eager to connect with others in the industry - whether you're an experienced professional or just starting out. Letâ€™s share insights, exchange ideas, and grow together!
